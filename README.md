### Notes:

#### Stuff I will eventually cover:

  1. Peek vs find (include backgroundReload notes)
  2. query !== live array
  3. Component Helper: https://dockyard.com/blog/2016/05/13/component-helper
  4. pushPayload and push (SSE / Web Sockets)
  5. EmberUploader


Questions asked on slack:
does anyone who uses `ember-metrics` know if there’s a way to get it to use Intercom (via`trackPage`) loading a user’s messages automatically, for example

Is it possible to create a computed property that sums the values of a property of the children (hasMany association)?  Say I had a team with multiple players where each player has a goals total attr, how could I create a computed property that maps by key and sums in one computed property? Right now I mapBy and then sum the resulting mapBy property
