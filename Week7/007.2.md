# Day 2
Setting up the Addon
testing the Addon


Today we will be creating an Ember addon that will display a popover with a little additional information about a topic. Ember addons are a great way to share reusable code between applications. In our case, we will use our addon for the School Directory app that we have been working on, but we will write it in such a way that we could easily use it for any app.

To get started we should know that Ember addons are at their most basic level, just Ember specific NPM packages.
