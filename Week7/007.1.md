# Solution and Prep

Last week you were asked to make the pagination on our School Directory app make the first, previous, next, and last page links only clickable if you are on a page where you can advance in the direction of the link. For example, if you are currently viewing page one of the results, then you should not be able to click `<<` or `<`, and if you are on the last page, you should not be able to click `>` or `>>`.

So, to start, we can add computed properties for isFirstPage and isLastPage in your contacts controller.

`app/controllers/contacts.hbs`:

```JavaScript
isLastPage: Ember.computed('page', 'activities.meta', function(){
  return this.get('page') === this.get('model.meta.total');
}),
isFirstPage: Ember.computed('page', function(){
  return this.get('page') === 1;
}),
```

Then we can implement these properties in our pagination links by just adding a disabled attribute to our buttons which is set to our computed properties.

```hbs
<div class='pagination-links'>
    <div class="btn-group">
      <button class='btn btn-primary' {{action 'paginate' 1}} disabled={{isFirstPage}}>&lt;&lt;</button>
      <button class='btn btn-primary' {{action 'paginate' previousPage}} disabled={{isFirstPage}}>&lt;</button>
    </div>
    {{page}} of {{model.meta.total}}
    <div class="btn-group">
      <button class='btn btn-primary' {{action 'paginate' nextPage}} disabled={{isLastPage}}>&gt;</button>
      <button class='btn btn-primary' {{action 'paginate' model.meta.total}} disabled={{isLastPage}}>&gt;&gt;</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

That is all we have to do to have our pagination links just a touch smarter.
