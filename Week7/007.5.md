# Exercise and link dump

## Exercise

Finish implement the 'setFeed' function for our addon.

Some direction:

* the format of the daily drip rss feed is: `https://www.dailydrip.com/topics/ember/feed.rss` (remember to pass in the topic do not hard code it)
* You might want to use `XMLHttpRequest()`
* So you don't have to think about parsing XML you can use `http://rss2json.com/`.
  * Your URL will end up looking something like this: `http://rss2json.com/api.json?rss_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailydrip.com%2Ftopics%2Fember%2Ffeed.rss`

Finally, setup your `daily-drip-feed` component to consume our service.
