# Solution and Prep

Today we'll see a solution to the previous exercise, as well as a few resources to help prepare you for the upcoming episodes.

## Solution

In the last episodes you were asked to add a `person` model that belongsTo the `event ` model. You can do this with by creating an `app/models/person.js` which would look like this:

```JavaScript
import Model from 'ember-data/model';
import attr from 'ember-data/attr';
import { belongsTo } from 'ember-data/relationships';

export default Model.extend({
  firstName: attr('string'),
  lastName: attr('string'),
  event: belongsTo('event')
});

```

We should add a the `person` model as a hasMany on the `event` model.

```JavaScript
import Model from 'ember-data/model';
import attr from 'ember-data/attr';
import { belongsTo, hasMany } from 'ember-data/relationships';
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Model.extend({
  title: attr('string'),
  description: attr('string'),
  address: belongsTo('address'),
  people: hasMany('person'),

  attendeeCount: Ember.computed('people', function(){
    let people = this.get('people');
    return people.get('length');
  })
});
```

We'll need a `person` mirage model:

```JavaScript
import { Model, belongsTo } from 'ember-cli-mirage';

export default Model.extend({
  event: belongsTo()
});
```

We'll need to update the `event` mirage model:

```JavaScript
import { Model, belongsTo, hasMany } from 'ember-cli-mirage';

export default Model.extend({
  address: belongsTo(),
  people: hasMany()
});
```

Create a mirage factor for person:

```JavaScript
import { Factory, faker } from 'ember-cli-mirage';

export default Factory.extend({
  firstName() { return faker.name.firstName();},
  lastName() { return  faker.name.lastName(); }
});
```

In our event factory we should remove our `attendeesCount` line as it is now a computed property.

In `mirage/scenarios/default.js`:

```JavaScript
export default function(server) {
  let addresses = server.createList('address', 10);

  addresses.forEach((address) => {
    let people = server.createList('person', Math.floor((Math.random() * 30) + 1));
    server.create('event', { address,  people});
  });
}
```
Let's add our people routes to `mirage/config.js`:

```JavaScript
this.get('/people', (schema) => {
  return schema.people.all();
});
this.get('/people/:id', (schema, request) => {
  return schema.people.find(request.params.id);
});
```
