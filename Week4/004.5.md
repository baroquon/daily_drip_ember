# Exercise and Link Dump

For our exercise today, we are going to iterate on the application that we were building this week. Yesterday we created a message posting component. Today, let's take the messages that we were creating and post them to the page. You should make sure that your messages that are posted to the wall persist even if their containing component is torn down. Let's also make sure that we can delete a message after posting it, and make sure that when we successfully delete a message, we keep the messagesRemaining count accurate. So, if we have 7 messages remaining and we delete one our messages remaining count should then be 8.
