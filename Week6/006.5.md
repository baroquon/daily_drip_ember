## Exercise

Yesterday we got pagination working on our contact app. For our exercise, let's try and make that pagination display a little smarter. In the template, make the first, previous, next, and last page links only clickable when a user can advance the page in the direction of the link. If the page attribute is at the beginning or end of the total pages disable the appropriate links.
