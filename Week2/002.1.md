# Solution and Prep

Today we'll see a solution to the previous exercise, as well as a few resources to help prepare you for the upcoming drips.


## Solution

In the last drip, you were asked to create an index route that is the child of contacts. This part was relatively straight forward. All you needed to do was create a template in `app/templates/contacts/index.hbs` and add the following line:

```html
<h3>Welcome to the contacts index route</h3>
```

The index route is the default path so, we didn't need to explicitly modify the router.js or the `routes/contacts/index.js` route.

Next you were asked to create an index template. Once again, no route or router modifications were necessary, only the creation of an `app/templates/index.hbs` and inclusion of the specified text:

```html
<h2>Welcome to our Contacts App!</h2>
```

The final portion of the exercise was to create two links to our index and contacts routes using the link-to helper. In `app/templates/application.hbs` it might look like this:

```hbs
    {{link-to 'Home' 'index'}} {{link-to 'Contacts' 'contacts'}}
    {{outlet}}
```

The link-to helper comes in two variants. An inline version, as shown above, and a block version. The block version would look like the following:

```hbs
{{#link-to 'index'}}
  Home
{{/link-to}}
```

## Preparatory Readings

This week we are going to focus on components, actions, then Ember Data with models. It might be valuable to look over the following items.

* [The Ember Component Docs](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Component.html)
* [Ember Component Lifecycle hooks](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.6.0/components/the-component-lifecycle/)
* To understand a bit about the wider world of components it would be useful to look over the [W3C Custom Elements Spec](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/)
