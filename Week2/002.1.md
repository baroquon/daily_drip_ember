This week we are going to focus on components, actions, then Ember Data with models. It might be valuable to look over the following items.

* [The Ember Component Docs](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Component.html)
* [Ember Component Lifecycle hooks](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.6.0/components/the-component-lifecycle/)
* To understand a bit about the wider world of components it would be useful to look over the [W3C Custom Elements Spec](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/)
