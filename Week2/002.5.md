# Wrap, Links, and Exercise

This week we took a pretty deep look at the methods available in Routes and Components. Next week we are going to build an app using some of this knowledge and we can see it all work together. Today let's do a little exercise. As we discussed, components are short lived, they don't hold state after being destroyed. Let's create an app that has a component that:

  1. displays a value
  2. has an input helper that allows a user to change the value
  3. maintains the value when the user navigates away from the route with the component
