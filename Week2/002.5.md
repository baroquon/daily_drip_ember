# Exercise

To build on the information that we went over this week, let's return to our contact-manager app one last time. Let's create a new show route that is a child of our existing contacts route. When linking to the new route use a `link-to` that forces the new `contacts.show` to fire the route's model hook.

There are a few things that need to happen:

* Set up a new route and template
* In the new route fetch the correct record
* In the `show` template display all properties of the contact
* In the show route add an action that deletes the current contact and transitions back to the contacts route.
  * To accomplish this, you will need to use:
    * [`transitionTo()`](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Route.html#method_transitionTo)
    * [`destroyRecord()`](http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.Model.html#method_destroyRecord)

## Resources
* [Ember Serializers](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.6.0/models/customizing-serializers/)
* [Ember route action helper](https://github.com/dockyard/ember-route-action-helper)
  Earlier we sent an action from a component to a controller. This made sense in our case as we were modifying query params. However, in many cases it makes sense to send actions from your component to the route rather than a controller. Until routable components land we need a little help(er) for that. This addon makes it possible to call route actions from a component.
