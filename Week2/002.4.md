# Component Lifecycle Hooks

Like the a Route in Ember, components also have a series of public methods that fire during the life of a component that you can use to perform any setup that you might need.

To get started let's go back to the app that we created to look at routes and generate a component. From the root of our example app (lifecycle-example) we can generate a new component and add it to the index template of the app.

```sh
ember g component example-component
vim app/templates/index.hbs
```

```hbs
  {{example-component}}
```
