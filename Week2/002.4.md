# Setting up Models and Adapters

Yesterday we set up some components and actions in our contact-manager Ember application. We are going to continue working on that app today by discussing and setting up a Contact model and and adapter that will help us connect our Ember application to a server.

## Setup

I have created two very basic server applications that will provide a suitable backend for Ember.

[Node/Express Server](https://github.com/baroquon/contact_manager_backend_node)
[Elixir/Phoenix Server](https://github.com/baroquon/contact_manager_backend)

Both of these are very simple server implementations and both will default to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). As has been mentioned before, Ember is an opinionated framework. One of the consequences of this is that if you do things Ember's way, it can be very easy. If however, you try to go against an Ember convention, Ember can make things difficult on you. One of the conventions that Ember has embraced is the [json api spec](http://jsonapi.org/). Both of the servers listed above are serving JSON API compliant payloads.

Once you get one of those two (or both) apps listed above cloned and running locally, we will be ready to proceed.

## The Ember Stuff

The first thing we are going to want to do is let Ember Data handle our data instead of manually creating an Array and a couple of objects in the route. Let's go ahead and create a model for our contacts.

```sh
cd /path/to/ember/project
$ ember g model contact firstName:string lastName:string email:string phone:string
```

Our newly generated model looks like this:

```JavaScript
import Model from 'ember-data/model';
import attr from 'ember-data/attr';
// import { belongsTo, hasMany } from 'ember-data/relationships';

export default Model.extend({
  firstName: attr('string'),
  lastName: attr('string'),
  email: attr('string'),
  phone: attr('string')
});
```

Now we need to update the model hook in our contacts route to pull from EmberData.

```JavaScript
model(){
  return this.store.findAll('contact');
}
```

Ember provides several methods for retrieving data.

* `this.store.findAll('contact')` - returns a promise that should resolve to all records of a contact type.
* `this.store.peekAll('contact')` - returns all records of a contact type that are already loaded in the local store.
* `this.store.findRecord('contact', 1)` - returns a promise that should resolve to a contact record with an id of 1
* `this.store.peekRecord('contact', 1)` - returns a contact record with an id of 1 if it is present in the store

If you have one of our server apps running locally on your machine at port 4000, there should only be one more step you need to take to wire up your Ember app. We just need to tell it where to look for its data.

```sh
$ ember g adapter application
```

Your newly generated adapter at `app/adapters/application.js` looks like:

```JavaScript
import JSONAPIAdapter from 'ember-data/adapters/json-api';

export default JSONAPIAdapter.extend({
});
```

We should change it to look like this:

```JavaScript
import JSONAPIAdapter from 'ember-data/adapters/json-api';

export default JSONAPIAdapter.extend({
  host: 'http://localhost:4000'
});
```
