# Component Lifecycle Hooks

Like the a Route in Ember, components also have a series of public methods that fire during the life of a component that you can use to perform any setup that you might need.

To get started let's go back to the app that we created to look at routes and generate a component. From the root of our example app from the route episode (lifecycle-example) we can generate a new component and add it to the index template of the app.

```sh
ember g component example-component
vim app/templates/index.hbs
```

```hbs
  {{example-component}}
```

An Ember component is made of two parts: a JavaScript file and a template. We will look more at the template when we create an app next week. This week we are going to look at the lifecycle hooks of the Ember component. There is a [good writeup](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.6.0/components/the-component-lifecycle/) in the Ember guides about the lifecycle hooks. I recommend you go over there an look through them. I will recreate some of that here and try and supplement it with a few examples of teams I have been a part of have used some of these hooks.

First, let's look at the hooks as they execute. We'll add the methods in the component's JavaScript file with some console logs to see them fire.

```JavaScript
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  // On intial render
  init(){
    this._super(...arguments);
    console.log('------------ In Component -----------------');
    console.log('Component: init - on intial render');
  },
  // on re-render
  didUpdateAttrs(){ console.log('Component: didUpdateAttrs - on re-render'); },
  // on initial render and re-render
  didReceiveAttrs(){ console.log('Component: didReceiveAttrs - on initial render and re-render'); },
  // on re-render
  willUpdate(){ console.log('Component: willUpdate - on re-render'); },
  // on initial render and re-render
  willRender(){ console.log('Component: willUpdate - on initial render and re-render'); },
  // On intial render
  didInsertElement(){ console.log('Component: didInsertElement - on initial render'); },
  // on re-render
  didUpdate(){ console.log('Component: didUpdate - on re-render'); },
  // on initial render and re-render
  didRender(){ console.log('Component: didRender - on initial render and re-render'); },

  // Destroyish stuff
  willDestroyElement(){ console.log('Component: willDestroyElement - on destroy'); },
  willClearRender(){ console.log('Component: willClearRender - on destroy'); },
  didDestroyElement(){ console.log('Component: didDestroyElement - on destroy'); }
});
```
