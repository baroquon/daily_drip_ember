# Components

Today we are going to look at routes in Ember. Ember's router is a really great tool that, like so much of Ember, gives developers a lot of power without having to do a lot of work. We are just going to step through some of the hooks that routes have available for you and see what they do. To start let's generate an empty Ember project.

```sh
ember new lifecycle-example
cd lifecycle-example
```

Now, let's generate two routes that we can transition between. The names don't really matter than much as we are just getting two separate routes that we can use to see transitions in action.

```sh
ember g route index && ember g route about
```

The first thing that you might notice is that for the index route that we generated, Ember did not modify our router.js - There was no need, we know what path index is attached to. Let's quickly create an application template with a couple of `link-to`s so that we can jump between our new routes.

In `app/templates/application.hbs`:
```hbs
{{link-to 'Index' 'index'}} {{link-to 'About' 'about'}}
<br>
{{outlet}}
```

Now, let's add some markup in our about and index templates just to help us see what is happening on the page.

`app/templates/index.hbs`

<h2>INDEX</h2>

`app/templates/about.hbs`

<h2>ABOUT</h2>

Now, let's start our server.

```sh
ember s
```

We can change back and forth between these two routes now. Huzzah. But let's take a look at what is happening when a route is loaded and unloaded. Make sure to open you developer console as we are going to be logging to the console to see what is happening.

In the index route let's override a bunch of the Route's methods and see what they each do. I am going to list these in the order that they fire.

```JavaScript
export default Ember.Route.extend({
  // This hook fires when the route is instantiated. Here you can do some setup work or preliminaries
  // before your object loads. Make sure when you override Ember's init method that you call
  // this._super(...arguments); so that Ember can do its setup work. This only fires when the route
  // is first instantiated.
  init(){
    this._super(...arguments);
    console.log('init() in index route.');
  },
  // The first hook that fires when you are transitioning into a route is the route's beforeModel.
  // The route has three model hooks fire sequentially and work in basically the same way. Although
  // the model hook has some unique behavior. According to the Ember docs, the beforeModel should
  // be used so:
  //   1) A decision can be made to redirect elsewhere without needing to resolve the model first. and
  //   2) for Any async operations that need to occur first before the model is attempted to be resolved.
  // For example, we can confirm that a user is authenticated before we load the route's model. If the user
  // is not authenticated we can use the transition param to redirect to an authentication route. Just remember,
  // any async operations that need to complete before we load the model go here. Any promise that we return here
  // will resolve before we move on to the model hook. If we return something other than a promise, the hook resolves
  // immediately.
  // Also, if we have a route with a dynamic segment and we transition to it by passing in context, for instance a
  // link-to with an included object, the model hook wont fire. So, we will need to perform any async operations that we
  // might otherwise perform in the model hook in the beforeModel or afterModel.
  beforeModel(/* transition */){
    // e.g. transition.abort();
    console.log('beforeModel() in index route');
  },
  // The model hook works almost exactly like the beforeModel except that it does not fire on every
  // transition. If your route corresponds to a url with a dynamic segment, like `/contacts/1` and you
  // pass in the context to the route when you transition, for instance with a link-to that has an object as
  // its argument, the model hook wont fire as Ember assumes that it has all the information it needs to
  // complete the transition. This is laid out really nicely in the docs but when I was new to Ember I
  // wasted a bit of time here and I have regularly seen new Ember devs stumble here. Once again,
  // we can be assured that all promises here will resolve before Ember moves on to the afterModel.
  // This is where you will do the bulk of your data fetching. The return value here is attached to the
  // controller as the model property.
  model(/*params, transition*/){
    console.log('model() in index route');
  },
  // The afterModel works just like the beforeModel except you have the resolved return value from the
  // model hook available to you. Here you can do any logic that you need to de before the transition is
  // complete but after you know the result of the model hook. Or, once again, if you already have a context
  // object and the model hook was bypassed.
  afterModel(/*resolvedModel, transition*/){
    console.log('afterModel() in index route');
  },
  // The activate hook is fired when you actually enter the route. I have used this hook to set a
  // custom title on a given route.
  activate(){
    console.log('activate() in index route.');
  },
  // The setupController hook is where Ember sets the resolved value from the model hook on the controller
  // If you need to do anything here, you can call `this._super(...arguments);` to preserve that behavior
  // and you can set whatever synchronous values on the controller that you want. But don't make any async
  // calls here, (I've seen it in the wild) they belong in one of the model hooks above.
  setupController(controller, model){
    this._super(controller, model);
    // this can be called in the template as {{someProp}}
    controller.set('someProp', 'Hey, I am a property set from the setupController hook in the route. Huzzah.');
    console.log('setupController() in index route');
  },
  // Those are the hooks that fire when you are transitioning into the route.
  // This hook fires when you leave the route. If I set a custom title on the route above, I would
  // remove it here. Anything you need to do when leaving the route.
  deactivate(){
    console.log('deactivate() in index route');
  },
  actions: {
    didTransition(){
      console.log('didTransition() from the index route');
    },
    willTransition(){
      console.log('willTransition() from the index route');
    }
  }
});
```

All of this is somewhat abstract, but I thought it would be useful to have an overview to provide some understanding of the methods that are available to us from the Ember route. I hope this was helpful. Next time we will do something similar for the lifecycle hooks on components. See you then.
