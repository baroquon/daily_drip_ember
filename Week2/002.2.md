We are going to generate one more route, a child to contacts.

    ember g route contacts/contact

Let's modify a few things, starting the router.js file. Change it to look like this:

    Router.map(function() {
      this.route('contacts', function() {
        this.route('contact', { path: ':contact_id' });
      });
    });

this.route accepts an object as a second paramater with a path key that we can use if we want the path to be different than the route name. In this case, we need a dynamic segment, so we set the path to the contact's id.

Now, lets change the newly created contact template (app/templates/contacts/contact.hbs) to display some information about a single contact rather than an array of contacts. In this case, let's replace the `{{outlet}}` with this:

    {{model.firstName}} {{model.lastName}}
    <br>
    {{model.email}}

The last thing we need to do is pass the object that we want to display to the new route. We will do this by using another helper link-to. Lets add the link-to back in the contacts template.

    <ul>
      {{#each model as |contact|}}
        {{#link-to 'contacts.contact' contact}}
          <li>
            {{contact.firstName}} {{contact.lastName}}
          </li>
        {{/link-to}}
      {{/each}}
    </ul>

There are a couple of things to notice here. First, the link-to: the first part `contacts.contact` is a string representing the route. The second part is the object that we are passing to that route. Also, you may have noticed that we didn't add a model on the contacts/contact route. Since we passed the object into the link-to Ember skips the model hook in the route. It is assumed that we have all the information that we need to render without firing the model hook. If we ever need to force the model hook to fire, we can by passing in the id rather than the object to the link-to:

    {{#link-to 'contacts.contact' contact.id}}

To have a functioning app, you will need an model hook on any route that passes data to a template.
