# Links and Exercise

## Exercise

Our exercise today is going to be to refactor a few observers. Either turn them into computed properties or use a component's lifecycle hook if needed. You can make some assumptions about other properties that are being used in the observers.

### First:

```JavaScript
formHasUpload: Ember.observer('upload', function() {
  if(Ember.isPresent(this.get('upload'))) {
    this.set('needsUpload', false);
  }
})
```

### Second:

```JavaScript
resetOnSave: Ember.observer('resetChecks', function() {
  let reset = this.get('resetChecks');
  if(reset){
    this.set('isSelected', false);
  }
})
```
