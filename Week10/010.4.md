# Observers: The villain of our story

Today we are going to be talking about observers. Observers in Ember allow you to setup a function to trigger based on changes in any dependent keys. You might think, "that sounds a lot like computed properties". Well, you aren't entirely wrong. They are similar in that they take a series of key properties and fire when those keys change. However, unlike computed properties, observers don't care about a return value. If you create a computed property called 'fullName' that takes as dependent keys a `firstName` and `lastName` fullName is never actually computed unless it is called, it's lazy. Observers on the other hand are not lazy, they will always fire when changes are made. Ember core team member [Stefan Penner](https://twitter.com/stefanpenner) gave a terrific talk about observers which I highly recommend and I will link to it in the notes. He talks about a lot of the problems with Observers and generally states that they should never be used. I tend to agree with Mr. Penner. However, they are a core part of the Ember API and if you work in existing code bases you will encounter them. Just when you do encounter them try and refactor them out.

Ok, so let's get to it. The easiest way to get started is to navigate to [Ember twiddle](https://ember-twiddle.com/).

In the application controller let's add two properties, a `firstName` and a `lastName`:

```JavaScript
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  appName: 'Ember Twiddle',
  firstName: 'Brandon',
  lastName: 'Blaylock'
});
```

Now, let's add two inputs to the application template that are bound to these two properties:

```handlebars
First Name: {{input value=firstName}}
<br>
<br>
Last Name: {{input value=lastName}}
```
