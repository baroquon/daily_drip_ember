# Getting started with the Run Loop

The Ember run loop can be a bit of a mystery to all Ember developers, particularly new developers. In most cases, Ember abstracts away all of the tough details about the run loops so we, as Ember developers, don't have to think about it too much. It has even been written that Ember developers don't need to know about the Run loop. This seems a bit short sighted. We are going to try and demystify what the run loop does and how it works.

At it's most basic level, the Ember run loop is a queuing system for all the events triggered by user interactions in your Ember app. The run loop consists of a series of queues that allows you to batch and prioritize your work in a way that makes your performant and efficient.
