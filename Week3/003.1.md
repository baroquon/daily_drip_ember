# Solution and Prep

Today we'll see a solution to the previous exercise, as well as a few resources to help prepare you for the upcoming drips.

## Solution

In the last drip you were tasked with creating a `contacts.show` route for our contacts-management application that we have created. There are a couple of ways to go about this. You can either manually create and modify the files, or use the generators. For our purposes, let's do the work by hand.

First, we need to modify our router by adding the show route with a dynamic segment for the id.

```js
import Ember from 'ember';
import config from './config/environment';

const Router = Ember.Router.extend({
  location: config.locationType
});

Router.map(function() {
  this.route('contacts', function() {
    this.route('show', { path: ':contact_id' });
  });
});

export default Router;
```

Then we need to create the route in `app/routes/contacts/show.js`:

```js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model(params){
    return this.store.findRecord('contact', params.contact_id);
  }
});
```
