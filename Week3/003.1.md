# Solution and Prep

Today we'll see a solution to the previous exercise, as well as a few resources to help prepare you for the upcoming drips.

## Solution

In the last drip you were tasked with creating a `contacts.show` route for our contacts-management application that we created. There are a couple of ways to go about this. You can either manually create and modify the files, or use the generators. For our purposes, let's do the work by hand.

First, we need to modify our router by adding the show route with a dynamic segment for the id.

```js
import Ember from 'ember';
import config from './config/environment';

const Router = Ember.Router.extend({
  location: config.locationType
});

Router.map(function() {
  this.route('contacts', function() {
    this.route('show', { path: ':contact_id' });
  });
});

export default Router;
```

Then we need to create the route in `app/routes/contacts/show.js`:

```js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model(params){
    return this.store.findRecord('contact', params.contact_id);
  }
});
```

We will need to create a template in `app/templates/contacts/show.hbs`. I made mine look like this:

```hbs
<div>
  <h2>
    {{model.firstName}}
    {{model.lastName}}
  </h2>
  <h3>
    {{model.email}} | {{model.phone}}
  </h3>
  <br>
</div>
{{#each model.addresses as |address|}}
  <div>
    {{address.street1}}
    {{address.street2}}
    <br>
    {{address.city}}, {{address.state}} {{address.zip}}
  </div>
  <br>
{{/each}}
```

Ideally, we would have created components for displaying the contact. But for the sake of simplicity we will avoid that for now. Now that we have that created, we should make our address model. In `app/models/address.js`:

```javascript
import Model from 'ember-data/model';
import attr from 'ember-data/attr';
import { belongsTo } from 'ember-data/relationships';
// import { hasMany } from 'ember-data/relationships';

export default Model.extend({
  street1: attr('string'),
  street2: attr('string'),
  city: attr('string'),
  state: attr('string'),
  zip: attr('string'),
  contact: belongsTo('contact')
});
```

We also need to add the relationship to out contact model:

```javascript
import { hasMany } from 'ember-data/relationships';
...
addresses: hasMany('address')
```

Now, that we have all of that out of the way, we can link to our new route in our old template. In `app/templates/contacts.hbs`:

```hbs
<nav class='contacts'>
  {{#each model as |contact|}}
    {{#link-to 'contacts.show' contact.id}}{{contact.firstName}} {{contact.lastName}}{{/link-to}}
  {{/each}}
</nav>
{{outlet}}
```

Again, if you were building an application for production, you would definately want to employ more components and use the controller/template as just a passthrough for the model. At any rate, that about does it for this exercise.
