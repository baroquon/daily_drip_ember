# Solution and Prep

This week we are going to put some of our new found knowledge about Routes and Components into use by continuing to iterate on the simple contacts application that we started in (Week 1)[https://github.com/baroquon/daily_drip_ember/blob/master/Week1/001.4.md].

## Solution

TODO

* [The Ember Component Docs](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Component.html)
* [Ember Component Lifecycle hooks](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.6.0/components/the-component-lifecycle/)
* To understand a bit about the wider world of components it would be useful to look over the [W3C Custom Elements Spec](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/)
