## Exercise

Yesterday we looked at a few methods in the computed namespace in Ember. Today let's put s few of those (any maybe a few others) to use. This will be easiest to complete using [Ember Twiddle](https://ember-twiddle.com/).

1. Given this component:

```
export default Ember.Component.extend({
  name: 'David Ross',
  position: 'Catcher'
});`
```
add a computed property that returns `name` and `position` in an array:

```
=> ['David Ross', 'Catcher']
```

2. You have a property on a controller that is an array of values, create a computed property that returns true if the "property is null, an empty string, empty array, or empty function."

3. Given this array: `['Jim', 'Josh', 'Brandon', 'Sarah',  'Jack', 'Kristen', 'Adam']`, create an input in the template, and a computed property in the controller that filters those values by the value of the input.

Hint: The first two are one liners.
