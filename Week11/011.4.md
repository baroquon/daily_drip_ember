# Once More with Computed Properties

We have looked at computed properties a couple of times now. Today, we are going to revisit them one final time. We are going to look at the array computed, `@each`, and `filterBy` and `filter`.

We are going to look at these with Ember Twiddle once again. Let's first look at how to watch an array with a computed property. If we have a list of number:

```JavaScript
listNums: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```
And we want to watch this for changes, let's set up an action to add items to this list:

```handlebars
{{input value=toAddToList}}
<button {{action 'addToList'}}>Add Number To List</button>
```

```JavaScript
actions: {
  addToList(){
    this.get('listNums').addObject(this.get('toAddToList'))
    this.set('toAddToList', '');
  }
}
```

Now back in our template, let's show the `listNums` values and the values in a computed that we will change called `computedListNums`.

```handlebars
<h3>
  listNums:
</h3>
{{#each listNums as |num|}}
  {{num}}<br>
{{/each}}
<h3>
  listNumsComputed:
</h3>
{{#each listNumsComputed as |num|}}
  {{num}}<br>
{{/each}}
```

Now, let's create that computed property. You might write it something like this:

```JavaScript
listNumsComputed: Ember.computed('listNums', function(){
  return this.get('listNums');
})
```

But as you can see as we add numbers here, that doesn't work. Why is that? It is because the computed property is watching the property listNums, but list numbers isn't really changing, it is still referencing the same array, we are just adding numbers to the array, not changing the property itself. To correct this, we just have to change our computed property just a touch.

```JavaScript
listNumsComputed: Ember.computed('listNums.[]', function(){
  return this.get('listNums');
})
```

Now we are watching for changes in the array rather than changes in the property. And as you can see it works, so if you need to create a computed property that watches the values of an array, you just add the dot and square brackets and it will work as expected.

Now, let's look at the `@each` for computed. If you have an array of objects and you want to watch one of the properties on the object you can use the computed `@each`. Let's look at that.

First, let's update our template to iterate over an object and add an action to toggle some property on that object.

```handlebars
<h3>
  objArray
</h3>
{{#each objArray as |obj|}}
  {{obj.name}} - {{obj.best}}<br>
  <button {{action 'toggleOpt' obj}}>Toggle Best</button><br>
{{/each}}
<h3>
  computedObjArr
</h3>
{{#each computedObjArr as |obj|}}
  {{obj}}<br>
{{/each}}
```

Now, in the controller, lets add our array of objects, implement our action, then we can add our computed property.

```JavaScript
objArray: [
  Ember.Object.create({name: 'Cubs', best: true}),
  Ember.Object.create({name: 'Bears', best: false}),
  Ember.Object.create({name: 'Bulls', best: false}),
  Ember.Object.create({name: 'Blackhawks', best: true})
],
computedObjArr: Ember.computed('objArray', function(){
  return this.get('objArray').map(obj => obj.get('best'));
}),
actions:{
  toggleOpt(obj){
    obj.toggleProperty('best');
  }
}
```

First lets look at it just referencing the `objArray`, obviously, this doesn't work. Now, if we add the array brackets, it still doesn't work. In this case we need `@each` and the property that we want to watch.

```JavaScript
computedObjArr: Ember.computed('objArray.@each.best', function(){
  return this.get('objArray').map(obj => obj.get('best'));
})
```

Now we can see that our computed is working. We can actually make this a little more concise use Ember.computed's mapBy method:

```JavaScript
computedObjArr: Ember.computed.mapBy('objArray', 'best')
```

We can use most of this code to look at filterBy. Let's just add a computed property that filters our objects by the `best` property:

```JavaScript
computedObjArrBest: Ember.computed.filterBy('objArray', 'best'),
computedObjArrNotBest: Ember.computed.filterBy('objArray', 'best', false),
```

We can also use `Ember.computed.filter()` which takes an object as its first argument and a callback function as its second argument. The signature of the callback is item, index, array. So, to get the same result as the best computed above we could do:

```JavaScript
computedObjArrBest: Ember.computed.filter('objArray', function(obj){
  return obj.get('best');
}),
```

That's it for today, I'll see you tomorrow when we get will have an exercise and look at some links.
