## Exercise

[Here is a branch of the Rails app from yesterday](https://github.com/baroquon/best_shows/tree/008.5) but the API response for the shows route has been modified slightly. It now returns this response:

```JSON
{
  "great-shows": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      ...
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      ...
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      ...
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, this is a bit different from the payload being returned yesterday. So the exercise: set up a serializer to munge this payload so Ember Data can read it.
