# Completing our addon filling out the readme, publishing to npm, setting up CI.

For the last week we have been working on creating a very basic addon that essentially just allows you to embed an RSS feed from Daily Drip in your Ember application. This might not be the *most* useful addon, but if we don't have a readme it will be totally worthless. If no one knows what your addon does, no one can use it. So, let's fill out our readme so people that find our addon know exactly what it does and exactly how to use it.

```md
# Ember Daily Drip Feed

This is a super simple drop in RSS feed for Daily Drips for Ember.

## Installation

```sh
ember install ember-daily-drip-feed
```

## Usage

Then where ever you want to include the feed list, just add

```handlebars
{{daily-drip-feed topic='ember'}}
```

Presently the list of available topics for Daily Drip are:

* ember
* elm
* sidekiq
* html-css
* elm-remote-meetup
* elixir
* elixir-remote-meetup

This addon supplies an unstyled `ul`.
```

The thinking with the unstyled ul is that consumers of the addon probably have their own styles that they will want to apply and the best thing that we as addon authors can do is stay out of their way. I think that is a perfectly adequate README. Let's add that and push it.

```sh
git add .
git commit -m'added README'
```

Now, let's publish our addon to npm so that people can find it. The first thing you will need to do, if you have not already is to create a user on the npm registry. To do this from your console you will type `npm adduser`. We wont walk through this process here but I will link to a how to video from npm in the episode resources. To actually publish your addon, from inside your addon root, type `npm publish`. Now we can go to https://npmjs.com/package/ember-daily-drip-feed and we see our new addon.

The last thing that we want to do today is to setup Continuous integration on our addon so that tests are run and we can get one of those really cool badges on our Github readme. One great tool for this is Travis CI, all open source projects are free so it is really ideal for our purposes here. It's also worth noting that this step is useful for all of your projects, not just your addons.

First, go to https://travis-ci.org/ and sign in or create a profile and give Travis access to your Github repos. Then go to your profile https://travis-ci.org/profile/baroquon and click sync account. Find the repo you want to build against and turn it on. Now, when you push, your tests will be run. You will notice that for our addon, we did not have to create a `.travis.yml` file. This is because Ember CLI generated one for us when we first created the addon. Once again Ember CLI has our back.

Now, to get that nifty badge. Go to travis page for your app, click on the badge in the top right and copy the link. In your README insert:

```sh
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/baroquon/ember-daily-drip-feed.svg?branch=master)
```

So that about does it. We now have a published addon, with Travis CI integration, a filled out README that even includes an awesome badge with the status of our build.
