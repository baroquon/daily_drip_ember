# Serializers and Adapters

To this point we have glossed over both Serializers and Adapters. We briefly looked at an adapter as we customized the `host` property and looked at changing `headers` and `namespace` properties. We haven't really looked at serializers at all and we have gotten away with that to this point because where we have used a backend we have used one that serves up a JSON API compliant payload. But, what if we had a non-compliant payload. Well, I have set up a basic rails 5 api only app [here](https://github.com/baroquon/best_shows) that serves up a payload that looks like this:

```JSON
[
  {
    "id": 4,
    "title": "Community",
    "description": "Community is an American television sitcom created by Dan Harmon that premiered on NBC on September 17, 2009. The single-camera series follows an ensemble cast of characters played by Joel McHale, Gillian Jacobs, Danny Pudi, Yvette Nicole Brown, Alison Brie, Donald Glover, Ken Jeong, Chevy Chase, and Jim Rash at a community college in the fictional town of Greendale, Colorado. It makes heavy use of meta-humor and pop culture references, often parodying film and television clich√©s and tropes.",

  }
]
```

As you can see, this is not a JSON API compliant payload. It is just some vanilla JSON. So, the question is how do we get Ember to consume this payload and produce models that we can use. So, make sure your rails server is up and running, then we can get an Ember app up and running.

```sh
ember new show_frontend
cd show_frontend
ember g model show title:string description:string # perhaps not the best model name nonetheless...
ember g route index
vim app/routes/index.js
```

app/routes/index.js:
```JavaScript
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model(){
    return this.store.findAll('show');
  }
});
```

app/templates/index.js:
```handlebars
<ul>
  {{#each model as |show|}}
    <li><strong>{{show.title}}</strong> - {{show.description}}</li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
```

Now, let's create an adapter to tell our ember app where to get its data from. Then let's open up our new adapter and add a host.

```sh
ember g adapter application
vim app/adapters/application.js
```

```JavaScript
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.JSONAPIAdapter.extend({
  host: 'http://localhost:3000'
});
```

Now, if we start our Ember server and navigation to http://localhost:4200 we can see in our console some helpful errors that basically just say that the JSON document that we received from our server is not formatted like we expect. The error suggests that we use the serializer's `normalizeResponse` hook to munge the server response into a JSONAPI compliant document. But, in our case we don't have to do that. Let's start by generating a serializer:

```sh
ember g serializer application
```

Then let's open it up:

```sh
vim app/serializers/application.js
```

In our case, all we have to do to make this work is change `export default DS.JSONAPISerializer.extend` to `export default DS.JSONSerializer.extend`. The JSONSerializer does not expect JSON API document, but a very basic JSON document like that being provided by Rails in our example. If your use case is more complicated, you can use the serializer's `normalizeResponse` hook to make the document look like we want. Let's change our serializer back to the JSONAPISerializer and use normalizeResponse to turn our data into a JSONAPI compliant payload.

```JavaScript
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.JSONAPISerializer.extend({
  normalizeResponse(store, primaryModelClass, payload, id, requestType){
    let mungedPayload = {};
    mungedPayload.data = payload.map(item => {
      let currentItem = { id: item.id, type: primaryModelClass.modelName, attributes: item };
      delete currentItem.attributes.id;
      return currentItem;
    });
    return this._super(store, primaryModelClass, mungedPayload, id, requestType);
  }
});
```

So, this is a really naive approach, it obviously works for a findAll request, but it would be less effective with a findRecord request. Fortunately, Ember Data gives us access to the request type by way of the `requestType` param. We could use this param to property format our response depending on the type of request, or we could use one of the type specific hooks from the serializer.

* normalizeFindManyResponse
* normalizeFindRecordResponse
* normalizeQueryRecordResponse
* normalizeQueryResponse
* normalizeResponse
* normalizeSaveResponse

That is it for today.
