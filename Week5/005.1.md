# Solution and Prep

Today we'll see a solution to the previous exercise, as well as a few resources to help prepare you for the upcoming drips.

## Solution

In the last Drip you were asked to continue working on our app that had a current-user service. The service grew a bit beyond the original scope and was also housing a 'remainingMessages' property that would only allow a user to post 10 messages. The exercise was to display the messages that were being created, allow a the user to delete a message and keep track of the 'remainingMessages' property. There were of course several ways to acomplish this task. Let's look at one straight forward way to get this done.

I am going ot use the same current-user service to keep track of our messages. If we had a proper backend, we would probably have a model for our messages, and that model would be tied to a route. But, for our purposes, we'll keep it simple. In `app/ervices/current-user.js` we can add an empty messages array.
