# Solution and Prep

Today we'll see a solution to the previous exercise, as well as a few resources to help prepare you for the upcoming drips.

## Solution

In the last Drip you were asked to continue working on our app that had a current-user service. The service grew a bit beyond the original scope and was also housing a 'remainingMessages' property that would only allow a user to post 10 messages. The exercise was to display the messages that were being created, allow a the user to delete a message and keep track of the 'remainingMessages' property. There were of course several ways to accomplish this task. Let's look at one straight forward way to get this done.

I am going to use the same current-user service to keep track of our messages. If we had a proper backend, we would probably have a model for our messages, and that model would be tied to a route. But, for our purposes, we'll keep it simple. In `app/services/current-user.js` we can add an empty messages array. We can also change the decrementMessagesRemaining function to push a parameter to the messages array. In which case, we should probably change the name. We also need to create a deleteMessage function to remove a message from the message array. Our service might end up up looking like this:

```JavaScript
export default Ember.Service.extend({
  messages: [],
  messagesRemaining: Ember.computed('messages.[]', function(){
    const totalPermittedMessage = 10;
    return (totalPermittedMessage - this.get('messages').length);
  }),
  userInfo: Ember.Object.create({
    id: 1,
    firstName: 'Brandon',
    lastName: 'Blaylock',
    email: 'brandon.blaylock@gmail.com',
    twitter: 'baroquon',
    github: 'baroquon',
  }),
  addMessage(msg){
    let messagesRemaining = this.get('messagesRemaining');
    if(messagesRemaining > 0){
      this.get('messages').pushObject(msg);
      return { success: true, notice: `You have ${this.get('messagesRemaining')} messages remaining.` };
    } else {
      return { success: false, notice: `You are out of messages.` };
    }
  },
  deleteMessage(msg){
    this.get('messages').removeObject(msg);
    return { success: true, notice: `This message has been removed. You have ${this.get('messagesRemaining')} messages remaining.` };
  }
});
```
One thing worth pointing out here is that on our computed property we are keying off of 'messages.[]'. This says that we want to invalidate our cache anytime the array is changed.

We also could update our component's JavaScript to look like this:

```JavaScript
export default Ember.Component.extend({
  currentUser: Ember.inject.service(),
  gravatarUrl: Ember.computed('currentUser.userInfo.email', function() {
    const email = this.get('currentUser.userInfo.email');
    return `http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/${md5(email)}`;
  }),
  actions: {
    sendMessage(messageText){
      if(Ember.isPresent(messageText)){
        let sendMessage = this.get('currentUser').addMessage(messageText);
        if(sendMessage.success){
          this.set('messageText', '');
        }
        this.set('notice', sendMessage.notice);
      } else {
        this.set('notice', 'You should really type a message before you send one.');
      }
    },
    removeMessage(msg){
      let deleteMessage = this.get('currentUser').deleteMessage(msg);
      this.set('notice', deleteMessage.notice);
    }
  }
});
```

Finally, in our template we need to display the messages:

```html
<img src={{gravatarUrl}}>
<br>
{{currentUser.userInfo.firstName}} {{currentUser.userInfo.lastName}}
<br>
{{currentUser.userInfo.email}}
<ul>
  {{#each currentUser.messages as |msg|}}
    <li>{{msg}} <button {{action 'removeMessage' msg}}>Delete</button></li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
{{textarea value=messageText}}
<br>
{{notice}}
<br>
<button {{action 'sendMessage' messageText}}>Send Message</button>
```

That should do it. We are now listing all of our messages, keeping track of remaining messages, and we have the ability to delete messages after they have been posted.
