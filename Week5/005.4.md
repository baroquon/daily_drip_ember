# Ember CLI Mirage

If you do not already have our events app running locally, you can clone it at the state we expect at the start of this exercise here: https://github.com/baroquon/events-app/tree/005.3.solution

In the last episode we looked at acceptance testing our Ember application. But, our acceptance tests were weak and fragile. To truly test our apps well, we need good data. That is where [Ember CLI Mirage](http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/) can help us. With Mirage we can intercept our app's API requests and use [Pretender](https://github.com/pretenderjs/pretender) to generate mocks.

Let's get started. We are going to continue working on the [events-app](https://github.com/baroquon/events-app/tree/003.3) from the last couple of episodes. We'll need to do a little setup to get our events-app ready for Mirage. First, we need to create an application adapter. The application adapter will apply to all Ember models that dop not have their own named adapter. For instance, an Event model will use the adapter at `app/adapters/application.js` unless we create an adapter at `app/adapters/event.js`. Let's create our application adapter. From the project root type:

```sh
$ ember g adapter application
```

In your new adapter add a namespace property with the value `api`:

```JavaScript
import JSONAPIAdapter from 'ember-data/adapters/json-api';

export default JSONAPIAdapter.extend({
  namespace: 'api'
});
```

Also, change the route to call out to Ember Data for its model. In `app/routes/events.js` uncomment the  `return` and delete all of the fixture data.

```JavaScript
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model(){
    return this.store.findAll('event');
  }
});
```

Now, we are ready to get started with Mirage. Installing Mirage is as easy as installing any Ember addon. In your project's root directory type:

```sh
$ ember install ember-cli-mirage
```

You can think of Mirage as a fake API server. Just as we would set up routes on our server to respond to Ember's requests, we will set up routes in Mirage. To get started we will create Mirage versions of our Ember models. In our case we have an `Address` model and an `Event` model.

```sh
$ ember g mirage-model event && ember g mirage-model address
```

In the mirage models is where we will need to set up the relationships. In `mirage/models/event.js`:

```JavaScript
import { Model, belongsTo } from 'ember-cli-mirage';

export default Model.extend({
  address: belongsTo()
});
```

And add the inverse in the `Address` model.

```JavaScript
import { Model, belongsTo } from 'ember-cli-mirage';

export default Model.extend({
  event: belongsTo()
});
```

Now, let's create the routes to respond with these newly generated models. Right now, we'll just respond to find all and find record for addresses and events. In `mirage/config.js` add:

```JavaScript
this.namespace = 'api';
this.get('/events', (schema) => {
  return schema.events.all();
});
this.get('/events/:id', (schema, request) => {
  return schema.events.find(request.params.id);
});

this.get('/addresses', (schema) => {
  return schema.addresses.all();
});
this.get('/addresses/:id', (schema, request) => {
  return schema.addresses.find(request.params.id);
});
```

This would be a good time to restart your Ember CLI server. Now, we need to add our factories.

```sh
$ ember g mirage-factory event && ember g mirage-factory address
```

In our factories we are going to use faker to help populate our database.

In `mirage/factories/event.js` we will add our factory details. This will map to our Ember model for the most part, but we will specify our relationships in our mirage model and implement them when we create actually populate our db. Make sure to add `faker` to our import from mirage.

```javascript
import { Factory, faker } from 'ember-cli-mirage';

export default Factory.extend({
  title() { return `${faker.hacker.ingverb()} ${faker.hacker.noun()} ${faker.hacker.noun()}`;},
  description() { return  faker.lorem.paragraph(); },
  attendeeCount() { return Math.floor((Math.random() * 30) + 1);}
});
```

Now, you will do the same thing in your address factory.

```JavaScript
import { Factory, faker } from 'ember-cli-mirage';

export default Factory.extend({
  street1() { return  faker.address.streetAddress(); },
  street2() { return  faker.address.secondaryAddress(); },
  city() { return  faker.address.city(); },
  state() { return  faker.address.stateAbbr(); },
  zip() { return  faker.address.zipCode(); }
});

```

Now we need to populate our factories. We will do this in two ways, first for our development database, then we will set it up for our tests.

For development we will load our our db from `mirage/scenarios/default.js`. First, we'll create our addresses using server.createList. Then, we'll literate over them and create an event for each address.

```JavaScript
let addresses = server.createList('address', 10);

addresses.forEach((address) => {
  server.create('event', { address });
});
```

Here we see how to create both lists and individual objects. Now, if we were to start our server, we would see a list of ten events each with an address and populated with faker data. However, if we were to run our tests, they would fail as we have removed our fixtures and the data creates in `mirage/scenarios/default.js` is only loaded in development, not tests. To load them in our tests just add the same code from above at the top of the test that expects the data to be present. For example, in `tests/acceptance/events-test.js` our test might now look like this:

```JavaScript
test('visiting / and clicking events takes us to the events page.', function(assert) {
  let addresses = server.createList('address', 3);

  addresses.forEach((address) => {
    server.create('event', { address });
  });

  visit('/');

  andThen(function() {
    click('a[href="/events"]');
    andThen(function() {
      assert.equal(currentURL(), '/events');
      // This is the text that is in the events/index template - it should display if we have not selected an event
      assert.equal($('article h3').text().trim(), "Choose an event on the left to see details");
      assert.equal($('aside ul li').length, 3);
    });
  });
});
```

That's it, we now have a access to a great client based API for our Ember test and development environments thanks to Ember CLI Mirage and the awesome folks that maintain it.
