# Extending an Existing Application - Components

A big part of the benefit of Ember is that an experienced Ember developer can quickly get up to speed and contribute to an existing project. So, there is most certainly a benefit in exercises that involve cloning an existing project and modifying them. This also permits us to avoid a bunch of setup commands and redundant work at the start of the episode. So today, we are going to clone a [School Directory Project](https://github.com/baroquon/school-directory) and add some features. In this project we once again have a `contact` model with some attributes, a `contacts` and `contacts/contact` route. We are also using [Ember CLI Mirage](http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/) to provide our development data and our fake 'API server'. Finally, we are using [Bootstrap 4](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) for our css framework. There are a few addons that allow you to easily integrate Bootstrap with your Ember CLI project. For this repo I tried both [bennycwong/ember-bootstrap-4](https://github.com/bennycwong/ember-bootstrap-4) and [kaermorchen/ember-cli-bootstrap-4](https://github.com/kaermorchen/ember-cli-bootstrap-4) and they were both perfectly fine. If you want to you Bootstrap 3 for a project you should check out [ef4/ember-sass-bootstrap](https://github.com/ef4/ember-sass-bootstrap). It is also worth nothing that all of these depend on you having SASS available - see [aexmachina/ember-cli-sass](https://github.com/aexmachina/ember-cli-sass). Anyway, enough with the preliminaries, let's get going.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/baroquon/school-directory
$ cd school-directory
$ npm install && bower install
$ ember s
[Visit localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
```

If we visit the contacts route you might notice that we have  mixture of students and faculty in our contact list. We are using the same component (contact-card) to display their information. However, what if we want to see some information that is specific to a teacher or student? Say for students we want a list of their current courses and for teachers we want to see their education background. There are several ways to accomplish this. First let's generate our two components.

```sh
$ ember g component past-education && ember g component current-courses
```

First we'll open the `current-courses` template and modify it to look like we want:

In `app/templates/components/current-courses.hbs`: We'll pass in the contact so let's iterate over the contact's currentCourses and list the title, creditHours, and description. Adding this class so that Bootstrap will make it look pretty.

```html
{{#each contact.currentCourses as |course|}}
  <li class='list-group-item'>
    <h4>{{course.title}}</h4>
    <p>Hours: {{course.creditHours}}</p>
    <p>{{course.description}}</p>
  </li>
{{/each}}
```

Now, in the component's JavaScript we'll just add a tagName and some class names.

```JavaScript
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  tagName: 'ul',
  classNames: ['list-group', 'list-group-flush']
});
```

Do basically the same thing for the teacher's component. In `app/components/past-education.js` we'll make it look the same as current-courses:

```JavaScript
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  tagName: 'ul',
  classNames: ['list-group', 'list-group-flush']
});
```

In the template, it will be similar, but we'll iterate over the contact's `pastExperiences` property and include that model's properties.

```hbs
{{#each contact.pastExperiences as |experience|}}
  <li class='list-group-item'>
    <h4>{{experience.school}}</h4>
    <p>{{experience.degree}} - {{experience.major}}</p>
    <p>Minor: {{experience.minor}}</p>
  </li>
{{/each}}
```

Now let's open our contact-card template and add these new components. In `app/templates/components/contact-card.hbs`.

```html
<div class="card-image-container">
  <img src="{{contact.avatar}}" class="card-img-top" data-src="{{contact.avatar}}" alt="Card image cap">
</div>
<div class="card-block">
  <h4 class="card-title">{{contact.fullName}}</h4>
  <p class="card-text">{{contact.role}}</p>
  <p class="card-text"> <strong>phone:</strong> {{contact.phone}}</p>
  <p class="card-text"><strong>email:</strong> <a href="mailTo={{contact.email}}" class="card-link">{{contact.email}}</a> </p>
</div>
```

If we are going to display a different component depending on if our contact is a teacher or student we could use a simple conditional and just each component.

```handlebars
{{#if isTeacher}}
  {{past-education contact=contact}}
{{else}}
  {{current-courses contact=contact}}
{{/if}}
```

But, we don't need to. We can use Ember's component helper to get the correct component rendered.

```hbs
{{component additionalInformationComponent contact=contact}}
```

Now, we just need to create an 'additionalInformationComponent' computed property that returns the name of the component we want to render as a string.

To accomplish this, open `app/components/contact-card.js` and add a computed property called

```JavaScript
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  classNames: 'card',
  additionalInformationComponent: Ember.computed('contact.isTeacher', function(){
    if(this.get('contact.isTeacher')){
      return 'past-education';
    } else {
      return 'current-courses';
    }
  })
});
```

We have a computed property on the contact model called `isTeacher` that just returns true or false depending on the contact's `role`.
