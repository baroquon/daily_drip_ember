# Validations on our Edit

[Starting point for this Dip.](https://github.com/baroquon/school-directory/tree/009.3_start).

Yesterday we looked at editing an existing contact, today we will add the ability to validate those changed before they are set on the model. To do this we are going to use Dockyard's companion addon to Ember Changeset: [Ember Changeset Validations](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-changeset-validations).

To get started let's go ahead and install the addon and a create a directory for our validations.

```sh
ember install ember-changeset-validations
mkdir app/validations
```

Next, we will create a file inside app/validations called contact.js. This is were we will setup our validation object. For ember-changeset-validations our validations object is just a plain JavaScript Object and setting up validations is super straight forward. We just import the validations that we want to use from the changeset validators library. Then we create keys for all the properties we want to validate. We will validate the presence of our firstName, lastName, email, and phone. To have multiple validations on a property, we just use an array to validate the length of firstName and phone.

`app/validations/contact.js`:

```JavaScript
import {
  validatePresence,
  validateLength
} from 'ember-changeset-validations/validators';
export default {
  firstName: [
    validatePresence(true),
    validateLength({ min: 4 })
  ],
  lastName: validatePresence(true),
  email: validatePresence(true),
  phone: [
    validatePresence(true),
    validateLength({ min: 10, max: 20 }),
  ]
};
```

It is worth noting that we can easily setup our own validations as well, but that is outside our present scope. After we have our validation object set up, we just import this validation object into the parent controller and add it to the controller object.

`app/controllers/contacts/contact/edit.js`:

```JavaScript
import Ember from 'ember';
import ContactValidations from '../../../validations/contact';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  ContactValidations,
  actions: {
    submit(changeset) {
     return changeset.save().then(()=>{
       this.transitionToRoute('contacts.contact.index');
     });
   },
   rollback(changeset) {
     return changeset.rollback();
   }
 }
});
 ```

We then pass in the validation object as the second parameter when creating the changeset: ContactValidations

`app/templates/contacts/contact/edit.hbs`:

```handlebars
{{edit-card model=model
            changeset=(changeset model ContactValidations)
            submit=(action "submit")
            rollback=(action "rollback")}}
```

Now, let's go back to our edit controller and use our new validations. On our changeset object we have access to some validation methods like `validate`, `isValid`, and `isInvalid` among others. These check our changeset against the validations that we set up. For our purposes, we can just check the changeset's `isInalid` property. If the changeset is not valid we want to display the errors to our user, if it is valid, we want to allow the changeset to be saved. The changeset has an errors array that we will display to the use if there are errors.

The errors that are returned look like this:

```JSON
[
  {
    "key":"firstName",
    "value":"",
    "validation":[
      "First name can't be blank",
      "First name is too short (minimum is 2 characters)"
    ]
  }, {
    "key":"lastName",
    "value":"",
    "validation":[
      "Last name can't be blank"
    ]
  }
]
```

We really just want to get the validation message and print it out to the user. So, in our `edit-card `template we will set up a simple conditional that checks if the changeset is invalid and if it is, we will print our the errors. The validate function runs whenever a property changes. In out template let's add our error messages:

`app/templates/components/edit-card.hbs`

```handlebars
{{#if changeset.isInvalid}}
  <div class="alert alert-danger">
    <ul>
      {{#each changeset.errors as |error|}}
        {{#each error.validation as |err|}}
          <li>{{err}}</li>
        {{/each}}
      {{/each}}
    </ul>
  </div>
{{/if}}
```

With our validations object in place our changeset already wont save to the model if there are errors. But let's go ahead and disable the submit button as well.

`app/templates/components/edit-card.hbs`

```handlebars
 <button class="btn btn-primary" {{action submit changeset}} disabled={{changeset.isInvalid}}>Submit</button>
```

That is it for today. Tomorrow we will look at deleting a record and creating a record. See you then.
