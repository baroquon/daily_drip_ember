# Solution for last week and prep for this week

## Solution

In the last episode we had an irregular payload served to Ember and the task was to create a custom serializer that could normalize the
payload so that Ember Data could understand it.

We will start with our Ember app were we left off in episode 8.4. Basically just an Ember app with a show model.

Let's create an actor model with a name property that belongsTo a show.

```sh
ember g model actor name:string show:belongsTo
```

Then we need to add the relationship to our show model:

```sh
vim app/models/show.js
```

```JavaScript
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  title: DS.attr('string'),
  description: DS.attr('string'),
  actors: DS.hasMany('actor')
});
```

We can also add the actors to page. Change `app/templates/index.hbs` to look like this:

```handlebars
<ul>
  {{#each model as |show|}}
    <li>
      <strong>{{show.title}}</strong> - {{show.description}}
      <ul>
        {{#each show.actors as |actor|}}
          <li>
            {{actor.name}}
          </li>
        {{/each}}
      </ul>
    </li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
```

Now, we want to change our serializer back to the JSONSerializer and we want to get rid of the 'great-shows' payload key.

app/serializers/application.js

```JavaScript
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.JSONSerializer.extend({
  normalizeResponse(store, primaryModelClass, payload, id, requestType){
    if(payload.hasOwnProperty('great-shows') && requestType === 'findAll'){
      let newResponse = this._super(store, primaryModelClass, payload['great-shows'], id, requestType);
      return newResponse;
    } else {
      return this._super(...arguments);
    }
  }
});
```

This setup will remove the unneeded 'great-shows' key, but we still need to handle the relationships. We need to get the embedded records into the Ember Data store.

```JavaScript
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.JSONSerializer.extend(DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin, {
  attrs: {
    actors: { embedded: 'always' },
  },
  normalizeResponse(store, primaryModelClass, payload, id, requestType){
    if(payload.hasOwnProperty('great-shows') && requestType === 'findAll'){
      let newResponse = this._super(store, primaryModelClass, payload['great-shows'], id, requestType);
      return newResponse;
    } else {
      return this._super(...arguments);
    }
  }
});
```

So, this should work. But it results in one somewhat annoying behavior. In our console we get this warning:

```
WARNING: There is no attribute or relationship with the name `actors` on `actor`. Check your serializers attrs hash.
```

This is just Ember Data telling us that the `actor` model doesn't have an attribute `actors`. "Ok", we might say, "So what? I didn't say it did." But, we are using the `ApplicationSerializer` which means this serializer gets called for all model types and since we said actors are always embedded, Ember Data assumes we are a liar. To silence this warning, remove the `DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin` from the `ApplicationSerializer`, and we can create a new show serializer at `app/serializers/shows.js`. This new serializer should extend from the ApplicationSerializer rather than the DS.JSONSerializer.

```JavaScript
import DS from 'ember-data';
import ApplicationSerializer from './application';

export default ApplicationSerializer.extend(DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin, {
  attrs: {
    actors: { embedded: 'always' },
  }
});
```

That does it. We have successfully serialized an irregular payload. This week we will be looking at creating and updating records and we will deploy to Heroku.
