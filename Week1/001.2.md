Ember is opinionated Javascript framework. It makes building long lived, large web applications easy and fast. To begin exploring it, we'll walk through the installation process. We will be using Ember CLI to generate and manage our projects. Ember CLI offers a lot of advantages over alternative approaches. First, it provides a file structure that all Ember developers are familiar with. So, if you have an Ember CLI project, you can hire an Ember developer and they should be able to understand your product and even commit code on their first day. Ember CLI also provides a command line interface, and a baked in build process, all of this to increase your productivity as a developer. Let's get started.

## Installing

Installing Ember CLI is easy. Just use npm to globally install the ember cli package:

    npm install -g ember-cli@2.6

To confirm installation:

    ember -v

    ember-cli: 2.6.1
    node: 5.4.0

Now we are ready to create our first Ember project. If you are familiar with Rails you will likely find Ember CLI very comfortable.

## Creating our first project

To create a new project type:

    ember new first-project

This may take a while…

    cd first-project/

Now, let’s take a minute and look at our new project structure.

Ember is an MVC framework and inside the app directory is where we can see this structure in practice, and where we will spend most of our development time. We will go in more depth here later. For now, let’s get our app up and running.

From the project root:

    ember server

Then, in your browser, visit: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

You now have a functioning Ember app.

Let’s kill the server and go ahead and remove that ember-welcome-page addon from our package.json file.

    vi package.json

Remove the line that says ember-welcome-page. Now, restart our server:

    ember server

Look back at our browser, and now, of course, there is nothing there. So, let’s create an application template.

    vi app/templates/application.hbs

Add:

    <h1>The Ember App</h1>

And save.

When we look back at at our site, we now see our message.

The application template is the parent of all your ember templates. As long as your Ember app is running, your application template is at the top.

Let's do one more thing today. Let's go back to our application template and add one line:

    {{outlet}}

We'll learn more about this syntax later, but for now, just know that Ember uses Handlebars syntax for templates. This outlet will provide a place for the direct children of our application route to render their templates.

As you probably guessed, the application route is the parent of all your ember routes. You'll notice that we did not have to go to a URL other than root to view our application template. Since we didn't manually create an application route, Ember generated a virtual application route for us.

## Summary

That’s it for today. We now have Ember CLI installed and we have a working Ember application. Tomorrow we are going to get the Ember Inspector installed.
