# Exercise - Building Nested Routes

This week we got our first Ember application built and we learned about Ember generators, the router, routes, controllers, and templates. Let's try and build on that by creating a nested route.

Create an index route that is a child of contacts. It should be mapped to the URL path `contacts/`. Inside this associated template add the following text:

    <h3>Welcome to the contacts index route</h3>

Create an index template that is not the child of the contacts route. In the index template add this:

    <h2>Welcome to our Contacts App!</h2>

Finally create an application template and add two links to the new index page and the contacts page.

Hint: use a [link-to helper](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.6.0/templates/links/).

Note: don't forget about the `{{outlet}}` in the application template.

### [Here are the API Docs for the Ember Controller](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Controller.html)

If you want to find out a little more about Controllers in Ember this is a good place to look.

### [Here is the RFC Routable Components that I mentioned Yesterday](https://github.com/ef4/rfcs/blob/routeable-components/active/0000-routeable-components.md)

If you want a little insign into the direction that Ember will be heading in the next major release it would benefit you to look this over.

### [Here are the API Docs on the Ember.Computed namespace](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.computed.html)

Computed properties are an incredibly useful tool in Ember that you will find yourself using very often. We will spend more time with them moving forward, but in the interim it never hurts to peruse the docs.

### [The Ember discussion forum](http://discuss.emberjs.com/)

This is a good place to bookmark if you ever get stuck, or want to know how others solved their challenges, or if you need a little help yourself.

### [Ember Twiddle](https://ember-twiddle.com/)

Ember Twiddle is a great way to share small snippens of your application. It can be really useful for debugging or sharing solutions.
