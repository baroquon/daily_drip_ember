# Introduction

Ember is an opinionated javascript "framework for creating ambitious web applications."

Emberâ€™s main site is at [http://emberjs.com](http://emberjs.com).

Most modern Ember applications are created with [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com) which is a command line utility that also provides a project structure for your Ember apps.

The Ember community is very active and is one of the best resources for an aspiring Ember developer. They can be found on the [community Slack channel](https://ember-community-slackin.herokuapp.com/), over at [https://www.reddit.com/r/emberjs](https://www.reddit.com/r/emberjs), and in the IRC channel at #emberjs on [Freenode IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net).

As a matter of prerequisites for Ember CLI you will need [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node), [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node), and [Bower](https://bower.io/) installed.

Today is a great day to survey those sites and get the prerequisites setup. Tomorrow we will install Ember CLI and a go over a few basics.
