# Wednesday

Yesterday we installed Ember CLI and got our first very basic Ember app up and running. Today we are going install an indispensable tool for Ember development: the Ember Inspector.

## Chrome

If you are on chrome [go here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ember-inspector/bmdblncegkenkacieihfhpjfppoconhi) and follow the instructions to install the addon.


## Firefox

If you use Firefox [go the addons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ember-inspector/) and install the inspector from there.


Once you have the inspector installed, open up your terminal and cd to the root directory of the ember app you created yesterday. The start your sever:

    ember s

Now, in your browser, go to http://localhost:4200 and open your developer tools. At the far right of you developer toolbar you should now see “Ember”.

If you click on the Ember inspector you will have several options that will allow you view parts of your Ember application in depth as it is running. You can come here to view your model data, route structure, and the state of various properties on your controllers and components.

## Summary

That is it for today. Tomorrow we will learn more about Ember CLI’s generators and we will create our first routes and components.
