There were three exercises in the last drip that involved using methods on the Ember.computed namespace.

Yesterday we looked at a few methods in the computed namespace in Ember. Today let's put s few of those (any maybe a few others) to use. This will be easiest to complete using [Ember Twiddle](https://ember-twiddle.com/).

1. Given this component:

```JavaScript
export default Ember.Component.extend({
  name: 'David Ross',
  position: 'Catcher'
});
```

You were tasked with adding a computed property that returns `name` and `position` in an array. We can accomplish this using collect and passing in the keys to collect:

```JavaScript
export default Ember.Component.extend({
  name: 'David Ross',
  position: 'Catcher',
  deets: Ember.computed.collect('name', 'position')
});
```

2. The second like the first only requires use of a single line:

```JavaScript
emptyProp: [],
isItEmpty: Ember.computed.empty('emptyProp')
```
3. The third exercise was a little more involved but still pretty straight forward: Given this array: `['Jim', 'Josh', 'Brandon', 'Sarah',  'Jack', 'Kristen', 'Adam']`, create an input in the template, and a computed property in the controller that filters those values by the value of the input.

```JavaScript
names: ['Jim', 'Josh', 'Brandon', 'Sarah',  'Jack', 'Kristen', 'Adam'],
filteredNames: Ember.computed('nameInput', 'names', function(){
  let nameSearch = this.get('nameInput');
  let names = this.get('names');
  return names.filter(name => name.indexOf(nameSearch) > -1);
})
```

```html
{{input value=nameInput}}
<br>
{{#each filteredNames as |name|}}
  {{name}}
{{/each}}
```

This week we are going to look at Utilities, Helpers, and a bit more miscellaneous templating items. Here is some reading to get you on your way:
