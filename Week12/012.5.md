# Ember Wrap up

If you want to continue learning Ember there are several terrific resources available to you. First, the [Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com), the [Docs](http://emberjs.com/api/), and the [Ember Source](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) are the most valuable tools that you will ever have access to. If you would like to continue with a more structured approach there are several resources available perhaps most notably [Ember Map](https://embermap.com/) and [Ember Screencasts](https://www.emberscreencasts.com/). Also, if you have not already, you should definitely checkout [Ember Weekend](http://emberweekend.com/episodes).

Here are a few addons and projects that we did not get to over, but that could be beneficial to learn about, or at least be aware of moving forward:

  * [Dockyard/ember-composable-helpers](https://github.com/DockYard/ember-composable-helpers) I did link to this addon in a earlier drip, but we didn't really discuss it at all. It is definitely worth looking into as it can make your templates much more powerful and your JavaScript skinnier.
  * [Ember Exam Addon](https://github.com/trentmwillis/ember-exam) Has been linked to as well, but you should most certainly check this out, especially as your acceptance tests grow, this can keep them running fast.
  * [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - A lot of people use Firebase it allows you to develop and deploy with very little work and without having to think too much about your backend.
  * [thoov/ember-websockets](https://github.com/thoov/ember-websockets) This is an EmberCLI addon that allows you to integrate with a websocket or socket.io backend.
  * [benefitcloud/ember-uploader](https://github.com/benefitcloud/ember-uploader) At some point while developing with Ember you will need to add an uploader to your Ember app. Ember Uploader allows you to do that in an Embery-way and it makes that process really straight forward.
  * [nolanlawson/ember-pouch](https://github.com/nolanlawson/ember-pouch) This addon is a PouchDB/CouchDB adapter for Ember Data. Your app's data is saved client side and can be synced to CouchDB. This allows your app to work largely offline.
  * [ember-animation/liquid-fire](https://github.com/ember-animation/liquid-fire) Liquid Fire is the default addon for creating smooth animations for an Ember App. It has a huge community of users, great documentation, and creating animations for transitions is really straight forward.
  * (vestorly/torii)[https://github.com/vestorly/torii] Torii and Ember Simple Auth (listed below) are session authentication libraries for Ember. Both are widely used and have solid documentation and community support.
  * (simplabs/ember-simple-auth)[https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth]

You should definitely checkout the [Community page on the Ember website](http://emberjs.com/community/). You can of course also find me if you have any questions. I'm brandon on Daily Drip's Slack and baroquon on Twitter, Github, and the Ember Community Slack.
