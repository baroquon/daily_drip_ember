# Wrap up and one final exercise

If you want to continue learning Ember there are several terrific resources available to you. First, the [Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com), the [Docs](http://emberjs.com/api/), and the [Ember Source](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) are the most valuable tools that you will ever have access to. If you would like to continue with a more structured approach there are several resources available perhaps most notably [Ember Map](https://embermap.com/) and [Ember Screencasts](https://www.emberscreencasts.com/). Also, if you have not already, you should definitely checkout [Ember Weekend](http://emberweekend.com/episodes).
